This is a AI artical summerizer with the purpose of helping 
Extemtuouse speakers in the NSDA.

The OpenAI API is used to create a summery of an artical and then provide 3 responses.
A conservative response
A moderate response
And a liberal response.

This way Extempers are not only able to quickly digest information but they will also be able 
to see different perspectives of a topic.

A Microsoft Word Document will be the output of this program through the use of the docx library.
